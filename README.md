# This is my Version 2 of my To - Do list application using PyQt5 to create a windows 11 (dark themed) To do list application

The setup of my Code is simmular to the previous version of my code.

This code is a To-Do list that remembers everything previously saved and stores it as a file, for you to be able to edit in the to-do list application.

In the main code file, you will see the code required for the application to work. It's pretty straightforward from there, but there is one thing you WILL NEED:


You must make a "tasks" spelled like this. This text document must be in the same file directory as the code. This is so it can access the file and save the previously stored information.

The next step is to install the necessary dependency's ↓↓↓

We can use the python installer "PIP" to install the necessary library's

This is what the Final application will look like ↓↓↓

FYI - In the future I may compile this to c+ and publish it as a desktop application
